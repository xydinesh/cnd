# CND: A Tool for Cloud Native Developers

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/okteto/cnd.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/okteto/cnd)

**Cloud Native Development** (CND) is about moving your entire development workflow to kubernetes to reduce integration efforts to a minimum, but avoiding the time-consuming `docker build/push/pull/redeploy` cycle. 

`cnd` helps you achieve this with a mix of kubernetes automation, file synching between your local file system and kubernetes and hot reloading of containers.

The next links provide next steps to start using `cnd`:
